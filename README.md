# Icevest
A remote back up recording system for Live Podcasts
<ul>
<li>Purpose: Provide a Safety Net for Live Podcast Producers who broadcast using icecast.</li>
<li>Set up: You will need to modify the path object to reflect your system premises as well as modifying the show dictionary for what ever show/station you wish to record</li>
<li>Use: Call the script like "python3 icevest.py MMO" Where the argument MMO is defined as a key in the showdict</li>
<li>Suggestion: Because most of the shows I provide a backup for are on a schedule, I trigger these commands using cron. </li>
</ul>

Have fun.
